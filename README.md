# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

## Getting Started

The code is in the file run_analysis.R in the main directory 

## The experiments
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

### Prerequisites

The script can be run as long as the Samsung data are in the working directory 
under test folder for test group
under train folders for test group
and in the working directory for  activity_labels.txt and features.txt

### Installing
package to install :
dplyr
tidyr

```
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr
```

## Running the tests

Run the script in RStudio



### output

the result will be save under the file 
AVGDataframe.txt
